# SVG Logo Creator
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
Using Node JS and the Inquirer package, this application will prompt the user with a series of questions, and then create a SVG logo with the answers provided.
This will include up to 3 letters for the text, text color, SVG shape (either square, triangle or circle), and the background color.
You are also able to test the shape functions using the jest package, and run the tests to ensure the functions are working properly.

## Installation
To have this application on your own system, `git clone` the repository and set it up in your local system. Ex (Vs Code).
You will need to run `npm install` which will install the following package dependacies;
* `inquirer` : this will be the prompts and inputs of the application.
* `fs` : this will be what writes the actual README.md file.
* `jest` : this will be the testing package, and will test the functions of the application.

## Usage
In order to run the program, after obtaining all of the dependancies you will need to run;
* `node index.js` : this will begin the program in your terminal, and prompt you to answer multiple inputs to best create a new SVG logo file. 
* `npm run test` : this will run the jest package, and test the functions of the application.
* To view your SVG logo, you will need to open the file in your browser. Ex (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) This can be done by right clicking on the file, and selecting the browser you would like to open it in. (Ex. default server, live server, etc.)
